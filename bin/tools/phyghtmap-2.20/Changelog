phyghtmap (2.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Added working default TLS policies for NASA SRTM servers.  This is needed
    because the openssl defaults in Debian changed.
  * Added the --feet option and related code to output contour data in feet steps.
  * Made the python3 version the default one.

phyghtmap (1.72) stable; urgency=low

  * Replaced determination of the minimum elevation of a tile by a simpler method.
  * Fixed issue with wrong node id sequences when using phyghtmap in parallel mode
    to generate single output files.  This is done by evaluating the child
    processes' results in the order the child processes were started.  This change
    may cause a slight performance drop in this (parallel/single output) mode.
  * Fixed issue with possible one-node paths.

phyghtmap (1.61) stable; urgency=low

  * Added --download-only option.
  * Added timestamp (and changeset/uid) writing functionality for o5m output,
    switchable via the --write-timestamp option.
  * Restructured code to be mostly compatible with python3.

 -- Adrian Dempwolff <adrian.dempwolff@urz.uni-heidelberg.de>  Fri, 02 Jan 2015 23:10:00 +0100

phyghtmap (1.60) stable; urgency=low

  * Added o5m binary output format (via the --o5m option).
  * Added NASA SRTM v3 sources (this is default; for old v2.1
    SRTM data, say --srtm-version=2.1).

 -- Adrian Dempwolff <adrian.dempwolff@urz.uni-heidelberg.de>  Sat, 27 Dec 2014 22:35:00 +0100

phyghtmap (1.50) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixed generation of viefinder 1 arc second data index.

phyghtmap (1.47) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixed broken dependency matplotlib.nxutils which was removed in matplotlib
    1.3.0.

 -- Adrian Dempwolff <adrian.dempwolff@urz.uni-heidelberg.de>  Tue, 01 Oct 2013 11:00:00 +0200

phyghtmap (1.46) stable; urgency=low

  * Added input validation for the --polygon option.
  * Fixed licensing issues.
  * Improved handling of void values in number of nodes estimation.
  * Added the --void-range-max option to extend the range of height values read
    from the source hgt files regarded as void values (by default, this is
    only -0x8000 [-32768]).  This is mainly a workaround for using source files
    containing implausible height values.
  * Void areas are now generally masked with NaNs.  This was necessary to
    implement the --void-range-max option and has the side effect that contour
    lines adjoining void areas are not closed at the void area edges
    which---depending on the files' topology---can render the resulting osm
    files much smaller.

phyghtmap (1.45) stable; urgency=low

  * Added the --rewrite-indices option to force index rewriting from the
    command line.  This might sometimes be helpful.
  * Fixed issue with broken viewfinder 3 arc second index.
  * Fixed bug preventing phyghtmap from processing files specified as
    arguments on the command line.  Improved output filename handling for this
    case.

phyghtmap (1.44) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixed issue with too long lines in OSM XML output (some parsers can't parse
    very long lines) by adding new line characters to node ref lines.
  * Added an initial check if a file has to be checked for polygon intersection
    or not.  Eventually created tiles inherit this attribute.
  * Removed polygon intersection check in hgt.ContourObject.clipPath.  The same
    result is achieved by masking the input array and filling masked values with
    NaN which results in contour nodes with (nan, nan) coordinates.  The
    invocation of large polygon definitions should work much faster now.  Thanks
    to Juraj Štolc for pointing out the problem.
  * Fixed handling of faulty filenames in SRTM3/North_America directory.
    Introduced versioning of index files in this context.  Thanks to Giacomo
    Catenazzi for pointing out this issue.
  * Added a patch by Giacomo Catenazzi which allows for better file name parsing.
  * Added the -0, --no-zero-contour option which allows removal of the sea level
    (0 m) contour line in the output.  Thanks to Jaromír Mikeš for the
    suggestion.
  * Added the --hgtdir option which allows for specification of a custom hgt
    cache directory (patch by Edamame).
  * Improved output filename generation.  All data sources used as input for an
    output file are contained in the output filename, preserving the preference
    eventually given by the --source option.  Unused data sources are omitted in
    the filename.

phyghtmap (1.43) stable; urgency=low

  * Integrated adaptions of some patches by Thorsten Kukuk:
    - Added the --source option which allows specification of data source
      selection preference lists.  This option may be used instead of the
      --viewfinder-mask and --srtm options.
    - Fixed a typo in NASASRTMUtil.py. 
    - Added code to remove duplicate nodes in paths created using
      matplotlib.cntr.Cntr's trace method.
  * Fixed bug in hgt.hgtTile's getElevRange method.  In cases where the min/max
    elevation of a tile mod stepsize was zero, too high values were returned.
  * Added support for bounding boxes containing the E180/W180 longitude.
  * Fixed handling of polygon files with multiple polygon definitions.
  * NASASRTMUtil.intersecTiles() checks which source tiles are intersect by the
    polygon line.  Using this, the initial check which source files intersect
    with a polygon passed by the --polygon option is much faster.

phyghtmap (1.42) stable; urgency=low

  * Introduced a different pbf-Output implementation which doesn't require
    python-protobuf bindings and massively improves performance.
  * Removed all google protobuf specific code and adapted license (all code
    under GPL again).
  * The --osm-version option now defaults to 0.6.
  * Fixed bug concerning uninitialized 'ways' variable in main.py which occurred
    when evaluating source files outside a specified polygon which then yield no
    tiles.  This was done by a) variable initialization and b) by introducing a
    new routine in NASASRTMUtil.py which checks if a given source file inside
    the bounding box of a polygon passed by the --polygon option intersects
    with this polygon.  The side effect of this is that some needless downloads
    are avoided.

phyghtmap (1.41) stable; urgency=low

  * Changed DenseNodes longitude and latitude offsets to 0 and adapted
    longitude and latitude calculations.  This is needed because osmconvert
    doesn't implement longitude and latitude offsets.

 -- Adrian Dempwolff <dempwolff@informatik.uni-heidelberg.de>  Sat, 04 Feb 2012 18:30:00 +0100

phyghtmap (1.40) stable; urgency=low

  * Added pbf support (--pbf option).
  * Added polygon support (--polygon option).

phyghtmap (1.31) stable; urgency=low

  * Fix of a bug which prevented phyghtmap from correctly working under Windows.

phyghtmap (1.30) stable; urgency=low

  * Renamed --max-nodes option to --max-nodes-per-tile.  The special value 0
    passed to this option forces a single output.
  * Added --max-nodes-per-way option.  If specified, contour lines are cut to
    contain not more nodes than passed to this option.  The default value is
    2000, which is the maximal allowed value for OSM API 0.6 output.
  * Added the --corrx and --corry options.  Even if I think this is not useful,
    --corrx=X.Y shifts the SRTM data by X.Y degrees of longitude, --corry does
    the same with latitude.  In the context of srtm2osm, values of --corrx=0.0005
    and --corry=0.0005 were reported to give good results.
  * Added the --gzip option.  If specified, the output is directly written to
    gzipped OSM XML.
  * Fixed the XML output to comply with the definition on
    http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML.  This means that all nodes in a
    file are written before the way block.
  * All ids output by a single phyghtmap call are unique, no matter if --jobs is
    specified or not.
  * Added the --write-timestamp option.  With this specified, timestamp
    attributes will be written with node and way objects to the output XML.
  * Bugfix:  Syntax of viewfinderpanoramas.org's index site changed.  This
    phyghtmap version fixes parsing problems resulting in repeated file
    downloads.  People upgrading from any prior version should eventually delete
    their old viewfinderHgtIndex_*.txt files in the hgt subdirectory.
  * Bug fixes in the context of the --plot option.

  * Added --start-node-id option to specify values high enough to not collide
    with other osm data
  * Output node ids are now continuous; no id is given twice per run of
    phyghtmap
  * Fixed bug in NASASRTMUtil.getFiles():  Cached viewfinder files were not
    correctly identified when the --srtm and --viefinder-mask options differed
