description {
A map style for a hiking map of Oslomarka.
The cartography is adopted from hiking maps by Asker Skiklubb and
open symbol and color standards from Statens Kartverk.
It is suited for data from OpenStreetMap, including open geodata from
Ruter, Direktoratet for naturforvalting, DNT Oslo og Omegn, Foreningen
ØX, Naturvernforbundet, and Miljøverndepartementet.
