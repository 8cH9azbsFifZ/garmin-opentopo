Your help is welcome:
You can help to improve the OpenStreetMap source data, and therefore also this map. If something is missing or wrong in the source data you can add or correct that on OpenStreetMap. That's easier as you might think. Get registered on OpenStreetMap and just try it out. This way everyone can profit from your knowledge.
Information about defects found while using this map are also helpful. Also ideas about changes and improvments are very welcome.
Many thanks for your support.
